## How it works

The NAND gate is the complement of AND function. Its graphic symbol
consists of an AND gate’s graphic symbol followed by a small circle.
Here’s the logical representation of the NAND gate.
We start by declaring the module. module, a basic building design unit
in Verilog HDL, is a keyword to declare the module’s name. NAND_2 is
the identifier. Identifiers are the name of the module. The module
command instructs the compiler to create a block containing certain
inputs and outputs. The list in parenthesis is known as the port list,
13
it contains the input and output ports. Then we declare other datatypes
required in our design as follows.
wire Yd;
wire in Verilog represents an electrical connection. It is internal,
therefore not mentioned in the port list. Next,
and(Yd, A, B);
not(Y, Yd);
endmodule;
Here AND is the operation performed on A, B, to get its output in Yd.
Then Yd is passed through an inverter, and the output is obtained in Y.
The compiler understands the AND and the NOT operation the same way we
do. endmodule terminates the module.
